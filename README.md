# Baby’s Smart Curtain
This project aims to make Smart curtains that can facilitate humans, especially a mother in the process of opening or closing curtains automatically.

## Tools
- Arduino Nano
- Jumper 
- Servo Motor
- Resistor
- Sound Detection Sensor Module
- Arduino IDE
  
## Goals
The goal of this project is to develop a Baby’s Smart Curtain system that automates the process of opening and closing curtains, providing convenience for mothers. This system aims to enhance comfort and efficiency by responding to user commands or environmental conditions, making daily tasks easier for caregivers

## Step 1:  Requirement Analysis
- Design a system that can automatically open and close curtains to assist mothers in managing their tasks conveniently
- Analyze environmental factors, such as curtain weight and window size, to select appropriate hardware.
  
## Step 2:  Hardware and Software Setting
- Motor System: Choose a motor that capable of handling the curtain’s.
- Control Unit: Select a microcontroller to operate the motor and connect to sensors or inputs.
- Write a program for the microcontroller to control the motor for opening and closing the curtains.
- Implement input methods with voice commands.
- Develop logic for optional automation.

## Step 3: Prototyping
- Assemble the motor, controller, and other components according to the design.
- Test basic functionality, ensuring the motor can fully open and close the curtains without issues.
